# Kangal User Flow

We expect users to communicate with Kangal by only using API, which is provided by Kangal Proxy.
Here is an example of requests users can send to Kangal API to manage their load test.

#### Create 
Create a new load test by making a POST request to Kangal Proxy.
> This example CURL command uses JMeter loadtest type and jmx test file.
> Other load generator types may require other data in request.

```
curl -X POST http://${KANGAL_PROXY_ADDRESS}/load-test \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F distributedPods=1 \
  -F testFile=@./examples/constant_load.jmx \
  -F testData=@./artifacts/loadtests/testData.csv \
  -F envVars=@./artifacts/loadtests/envVars.csv \
  -F type=JMeter
```
#### Check 
Check the status of the load test

```
curl -X GET \
  http://${KANGAL_PROXY_ADDRESS}/load-test/loadtest-name
```

#### Live monitoring
Get logs and monitor your tests. 
Example of monitoring for JMeter described [here](jmeter-in-kangal/Reporting-in-JMeter.md#live-metrics-reporting)
You can also monitor the behavior of your service with your custom tools e.g. Graphite.

```
curl -X GET \
  http://${KANGAL_PROXY_ADDRESS}/load-test/loadtest-name/logs
```

#### Get static report. 
When the test is finished successfully Kangal will save the report, generated by the backend the S3 bucket. 

The report for a particular test can be found by the link `https://${KANGAL_PROXY_ADDRESS}/load-test/loadtest-name/report/main.html`

#### Delete 
Delete your finished load test

```
curl -X DELETE \
  http://${KANGAL_PROXY_ADDRESS}/load-test/loadtest-name
```
