## Why Kangal?
In Kangal project, the name stands for "**K**ubernetes **an**d **G**o **A**utomatic **L**oader".
But originally Kangal is the breed of a shepherd dog. Let the smart and protective dog herd your load testing projects.

With Kangal, you can spin up an isolated environment in a Kubernetes cluster to run performance tests using different load generators.

## Key features
- **create** an isolated Kubernetes environment with an opinionated load generator installation
- **run** load tests against any desired environment
- **monitor** load tests metrics in Grafana
- **save the report** for the successful load test
- **clean up** after the test finishes

## How it works
Kangal application uses Kubernetes [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).

LoadTest custom resource (CR) is a main working entity.
LoadTest custom resource definition (CRD) can be found in [charts/kangal/crd.yaml](charts/kangal/crd.yaml).

Kangal application contains two main parts:
 - **Proxy** to create, delete and check load tests and reports via REST API requests
 - **Controller** to operate with LoadTest custom resource and other Kubernetes entities.

Kangal also uses S3 compatible storage to save test reports. 

## Architectural diagram
The diagram below illustrates the workflow for Kangal in Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Components
### LoadTest Custom Resource
A new custom resource in the Kubernetes cluster which contains requirements for performance testing environments.

More info about the Custom Resources in [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).

### Kangal Proxy
Provides the following HTTP methods for `/load-test` endpoint:
 - POST - allowing the user to create a new LoadTest
 - GET - allowing the user to see current LoadTest status / logs / report / metrics
 - DELETE - allowing the user to stop and delete existing LoadTest

 The Kangal Proxy is documented using the [OpenAPI Spec](https://swagger.io/specification/).

 If you prefer to use Postman you can also import [openapi.json](openapi.json) file into Postman to create a new collection.

### Kangal Controller
The component is responsible for managing all the aspects of the performance testing process.

## Quickstart guide
This tutorial will guide through Kangal installation process and usage.

### Installing using helm
First, let's create the Custom Resource Definition by running:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellofresh/kangal/master/charts/kangal/crd.yaml
```

Add the repository to Helm:

```shell
$ helm repo add kangal https://hellofresh.github.io/kangal
```

Now, install the chart using the following command:

```shell
$ helm install --set environment=dev kangal kangal/kangal
```

> for Helm v2:
> ```shell
> $ helm install --set environment=dev --name kangal kangal/kangal
> ```

That's it, Kangal should be installed, check if is all correct by running:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kangal-controller-588677b854-r9qcs   1/1     Running   0          44s
kangal-openapi-ui-7c5dd8997c-jj4mk   1/1     Running   0          44s
kangal-openapi-ui-7c5dd8997c-vgm8c   1/1     Running   0          44s
kangal-proxy-7d95c9d65-6t44b         1/1     Running   0          44s
kangal-proxy-7d95c9d65-75dv4         1/1     Running   0          44s

$ kubectl get crd
NAME                              CREATED AT
loadtests.kangal.hellofresh.com   2020-10-05T13:22:59Z
```

For more information about the Helm Chart check [charts/kangal/README.md](charts/kangal/README.md).

### Creating first LoadTest
To run a LoadTest you first need to find Kangal proxy endpoint. Use this command:

```shell
$ kubectl get ingress
NAME                HOSTS                  ADDRESS     PORTS   AGE
kangal-openapi-ui   kangal-openapi.local   localhost   80      5m48s
kangal-proxy        kangal-proxy.local     localhost   80      5m48s
```

> This is assuming you have a properly configured [Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/). If it is not the case you can use [Port Forwarding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/).

With this information, you are now able to do a request to create the first load test.
Let's start by downloading an example JMeter test and POST it to Kangal proxy.

```shell
$ curl -s -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellofresh/kangal/master/examples/constant_load.jmx
$ curl \
    -H "Host: kangal-proxy.local" \
    -F "distributedPods=1" \
    -F "testFile=@constant_load.jmx" \
    -F "type=JMeter" \
    -F "overwrite=true" \
    http://localhost:80/load-test
```
```json
{
    "type": "JMeter",
    "distributedPods": 1,
    "loadtestName": "loadtest-dunking-hedgehog",
    "phase": "creating",
    "hasEnvVars": false,
    "hasTestData": false
}
```

Your first load test was created successfully, in this example with the name `loadtest-dunking-hedgehog`.

Check the load status with:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:80/load-test/loadtest-dunking-hedgehog
```
```json
{
    "type": "JMeter",
    "distributedPods": 1,
    "loadtestName": "loadtest-dunking-hedgehog",
    "phase": "running",
    "hasEnvVars": false,
    "hasTestData": false
}
```

Kangal Controller will automatically create a namespace for your load test and deploy the backend (in this case JMeter), check that by running:

```
$ kubectl get namespaces
NAME                        STATUS   AGE
...
loadtest-dunking-hedgehog   Active   3s
```

And you can check if the Pods started correctly using:

```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=loadtest-dunking-hedgehog
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
loadtest-master-f6xpb   1/1     Running   0          18s
loadtest-worker-000     1/1     Running   0          22s
```
