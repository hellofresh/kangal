## Contribution options
### Create an issue

It can be a feature request, a bug or simply a question.
Before creating a new issue, please check if something similar was already reported. Then you can continue the existing discussion.

#### Issue decision
As the maintainers, we are willing to accept issues that would:

We try to avoid introducing unnecessary complexity to the project codebase and want to make sure that newly implemented features will be utilized.

In case of a dissent we reserve the right to have the final decision based on our project priorities.
